# How does it work?

The initial events are generated by the user, when they tap on the "Grab new image" button.

The button is connected to an IBAction which disables the UI (preventing spammy clicks) and triggering a network call to fetch a new image from Flickr.

In fact, it fetches an entire album (with a hard-coded ID) each time, chooses an image at random from within the album, and displays that.

# iOS Networking

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for Udacity's iOS Networking with Swift course.

## Overview

iOS Networking teaches foundational principles of networking and how they are applied in an iOS-context. The course uses a series of example applications as demonstrations:

- ImageRequest
- SleepingInTheLibrary
- FlickFinder
- MyFavoriteMovies
- TheMovieManager

Each application has a corresponding "complete" version which is already fully-implemented. Also, TheMovieManger has two versions: one with and without a seperate "API client".

## Setup

Generally speaking, most projects can run without any additional setup. However, consult the iOS Networking with Swift course for more information.
