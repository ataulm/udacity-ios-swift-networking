# How does it work?

The initial events are generated by the user, when they tap on the "Grab new image" button.

The button is connected to an IBAction which disables the UI (preventing spammy clicks) and triggering a network call to fetch a new image from Flickr.

In fact, it fetches an entire album (with a hard-coded ID) each time, chooses an image at random from within the album, and displays that.
